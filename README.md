## About The Project
This is an example project to manage tags, hashtags in compose text fields. I implemented [VisualTransformation](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/ui/text/input/VisualTransformation)
 interface to apply styles to tags and developed a string operation function to remove a tag at once when user tries to edit a tag or write a new tag that doesn't exist in the list.
